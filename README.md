# CSE 590 Projects
These projects were designed to be run on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board.

**1) Project 1 Seven Segment:**
A simple project to help illustrate how strobing works and how it can be used to display a 7 segment display

**2) Guessing Game:**
 In this game, player 1 first enters a number on the board, and sets it. The board then clears the display. The task of player 2 is to guess the original number using feedback from the board about whether the number just entered was greater or less than player 1's number. The board then flashes the LEDs and displays the number of tries it took for player 2 to guess.
